# Nigeria-Renewable-Energy-Analysis
📊 Nigeria Renewable Energy Analysis
🌍 Situation

Nigeria is transitioning towards renewable energy to meet rising electricity demand and reduce reliance on fossil fuels. Understanding solar, wind, and hydro trends is crucial for planning sustainable energy strategies.

🎯 Task

The goal of this project is to analyze Nigeria’s renewable energy data using Python (pandas + matplotlib), focusing on:

Total renewable energy generation

Per capita consumption

Yearly growth trends

Renewable share of total consumption

⚡ Action

Steps carried out in this project:

Data Loading → Load dataset (nigeria_renewable_energy.csv) with pandas.

Exploration → Inspect data with .head(), .info(), .describe().

Feature Engineering →

Compute total renewable generation.

Calculate per capita consumption (kWh/person).

Derive renewable energy share (% of total consumption).

Trend Analysis → Calculate yearly growth rates for solar, wind, and hydro.

Filtering → Identify:

Year with highest solar generation.

Years when renewables covered >50% of demand.

Visualization → Plot:

Total renewable generation over time.

Per capita consumption trends.

✅ Result

Found the fastest-growing renewable source.

Identified years when renewable share exceeded 50% of total demand.

Created clear visuals of Nigeria’s energy progress.

Insights can guide policy makers, investors, and startups in energy planning.
